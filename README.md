# PrimeNumberIdentifier
The first program:
At first it takes two numbers from the user and raises the first to the power of the second.  
Secondly the program checks whether the number that we got is a prime number or not.
If the number is not a prime a possible dividers are returned.
#The program uses only int and does not uses doubles.



The second program:
Receives the array of coefficients and the X point and the power and calculate the polynom at that X point 
#The program uses doubles.
